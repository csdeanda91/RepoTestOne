        <p>
            Snakes are carnivores (meat eaters).
    Snakes don't have eyelids.
    Snakes can't bite food so have to swallow it whole.
    Snakes have flexible jaws which allow them to eat prey bigger than their head!
    Snakes are found on every continent of the world except Antarctica.
    Snakes have internal ears but not external ones.
